# TaskProcessingDemo

A complex C# project demonstrating real-world concepts, including threading, interfaces, async programming, and LINQ.

## Features

- **Task Management**: Uses `TaskItem` objects with status tracking
- **Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded task execution
- **LINQ Operations**: Filtering, sorting, statistics
- **Interfaces & Inheritance**: `ITaskProcessor`, `BaseTaskProcessor`, `AdvancedTaskProcessor`
- **Thread Safety**: `lock`, `volatile`
- **Async/Await**: Asynchronous task counting

## How to Run

1. Open the terminal and navigate to the project:
    `cd TaskProcessingDemo`
2. Run the project:
    `dotnet run`


## Expected Output

- List of tasks before processing
- Multi-threaded task execution messages
- Summary statistics after completion
